Read me about fake-api and react

##1)Open terminal and go into fake-api directory, run:

### `npx json-server --watch db.json --port 8000`

##2)Then open React project and run React app 

When you first open the React project you might need to run npm install

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##For now this React project works with fake api when we develop backend we will use real api that we will create using Django rest api framework.
